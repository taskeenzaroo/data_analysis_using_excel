This repository consists of Data Analysis Project using Excel about suicides in India in 2021
I have dataset for suicides in India in 2021 namely "NCRB_ADSI-2021_Table_2.5.csv" from https://data.gov.in/ . The data has been published by National Crime Records Bureau(NCRB)

Goal: My goal for creating an Excel Dashboard for suicides in India in 2021 is:

1. Understanding Suicide Trends:
Analyzing the dataset helped me in understanding the trends and patterns related to suicides in India in 2021 as well as identifying variations across different demographic factors such as gender, location, and socio-economic status.

2. Informing Public Policy:
Providing insights that can be used by policymakers to formulate targeted interventions and prevention strategies and highlighting areas that may require additional attention and resources for mental health support.

3. Raising Awareness:
Communicating findings to the public to raise awareness about the issue of suicide and encouraging discussions around mental health and the importance of support systems.

5. Supporting Research:
The analysis could contribute valuable information for further academic and research purposes. Researchers might use these findings to explore deeper insights into the underlying causes and risk factors.
